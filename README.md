# The Just Dance Unlimited Randomizer

### please don't sue me ubisoft, i have no moneys

## Usage:

From your favorite terminal, run

> `python song_scraper.py`

which should create a `just_dance_list.csv` file in the same directory as `song_scraper.py`.

Next run

> `python song_chooser.py`

to run the song randomizer. NOTE: This scrapes and loads only songs found in Just Dance Unlimited. You can edit the code to include songs from your favorite Just Dance year. I believe in you. 🙏
